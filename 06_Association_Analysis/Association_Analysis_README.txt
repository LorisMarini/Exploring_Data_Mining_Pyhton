Association analysis is really a different kind of analysis, and one of the things is we're gonna use different packages, because it is a very specialized set of requirements. We're going to use something called the apriori package for this demonstration. Now, it's not something that's included by default with the Anaconda distribution that you may have, so we need to install it separately. Now, I'm gonna mention that I did a substantial amount of testing. I was able to make this work well on Macs. I had trouble making it work on PCs, so this particular demonstration will be exclusive to Macintosh computers.

The first thing we're going to do is we're going to install the apriori package, and everybody has gonna have to do that. And then you need to import it, so it's available, and there we go. Next, we're going to do the data and the analysis really kind of in one big group here. We're going to use the same groceries.csv file with the market basket data. And we need to set a confidence level. I'm gonna use 05. That's the minimum confidence level, as one of the factors that goes into association analysis.

I run in this in one command, and you see, we actually don't have to specify the location, because it's simply looking in the same directory that the code is in. Now, let's take a look at a few other items that we get from this, because it's actually done the analysis already. We can check the five items in the market baskets, and have the highest level support in the transaction data set. That's gonna be a little easier to see how this works. Now we have to explicitly loop through this to see what we have. And what we have here is whole milk with support of .26, other vegetables .19, rolls and buns at 18, soda is 18, yogurt a 14.

And what this means, for instance, is that whole milk appears in 26% of the transactions in this particular data set. Next, we can look at confidence. We can check the five items with the highest levels of confidence. I think we're gonna run a for loop to go through this, and let's take a quick look. And what we have here is yogurt leads to whole milk that's 40. And that means that in all of the baskets with yogurt, 40% of those also contained whole milk. And we go down to whole milk, and rolls and buns, it's 22.

So, of the baskets with whole milk, 22% of them contained rolls and buns as well. Again, it's very particular to the data that we put into it, but this is the kind of information that you would wanna use in setting up a market analysis, and potentially in changing the way that you display items, that you price items, and the way you make them available to your customers.
